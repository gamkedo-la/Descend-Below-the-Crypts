Descend Below the Crypts Third Quest Story

The brave hero struggles to their feet.  Thinking, "Orcs... then Crypts.  This is not an accident.  This is clearly the plans of a being creating an army. An army of EVIL! And right at my Doorstep!  We heard the Skeleton King..."  The Hero clenches their fist.  "Magic... a wizard perhaps?" brows crinkling.

Wiping the sweat of their brow, the Hero looked up.  Their eyes closed slowly, taking in a moment of rest... and quiet breeze brushes their face.  Turning towards the air, stank, disgusting, retched, but coming from somewhere in the crypts.

The Hero looks and discovers the caves noticing the dark tunnels.  The smell stronger now, almost unbearable.  Along with the smell came a tingling across their body, "Magic."  They whispered, to themselves.  It was stronger now at the entrance to the tunnels.  More danger, more enemies, more challenges.

A moment of weakness, the Hero's exhausted body protested.  "Shall I keep going?"  Their mind began flashing of the villagers, their friends, their family, their hometown shifting through their mind.  Closing their eyes, the Hero resolves once more.  "Let's finish this."  And walks into the caves.
