(Hero's actions and thoughts upon entering)
Our brave hero enters travels past the perilous trials above and dares to enter the depths further.  But this is something only a hero can do, and a hero I will become, no!  A hero I AM!  Orcs are nothing, nothing can scare me!  AHHHH!!! Skeletons!  What!  Zombies!  Run!! No!  I am a Hero!  Shivveerrringg... Let's do this....

(After the first level is cleared and what they hear from the villagers)
The Hero had bravely defeated the Orc Leader and cleared the floor.  It was now safe!  Until a cold shiver that seemed to run straight through to the bones was felt.  A chill and prickly sensation crossed his shoulders. The deed is not yet done.  Evil still lurks in these hallowed crypts.  The holy enchantments must have worn off and there is no place for Evil to lurk near this Hero's home.
