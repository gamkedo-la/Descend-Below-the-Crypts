The Hero stands over the wizard turned necromancer's body.  Victorious.  Carnage covered their body.  Exhausted.  The body disappeared and turned into dust before their eyes.  What evidence of a fight, gone in moments.  

The Hero looked around at the room, the grime, the hardship to get here.  It was safe.  Safe as could be.  Taking in the sights, the dust gently floating downwards in the air like little sparkles.  The silence was deafening and welcoming.  

Taking a deep breath he headed back up....

***********
A crowd awaited the Hero, concerned looks as every single villager was there.  The Hero's friend was fighting, tied up and sat down, a look of displeasure.  It was clear he tried to run to up to help.  The villager's gathered closer and asked, "What happened...."

The hero gathered strength within and spoke, "It is done."  sighing then speaking again, "The enemies are no more."  A moment passed before there was a loud cheer and supplies, water, blankets and hugs moved forward... as the Hero was engulfed in happiness and love.

For the enemies have been vanquished... for now....
